# Gamified Library

A full-stack application for a gamified library system built with Node.js, Express, SQLite, JWT, and Vue 3.

## Overview

Gamified Library allows users to register, log in, and interact with a library of books. Users can upload books (in PDF format), track their reading progress, and earn XP to level up. Admin users have additional permissions, such as approving or deleting uploaded books.

The project includes:
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, using SQLite as the database, JWT for authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Frontend**: A Vue 3 application with Vue Router and Axios for API communication.
- The backend also serves the static Vue build from the `client-dist` folder.
